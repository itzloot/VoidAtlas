    <h1>VOID ATLAS</h1>
    <p>
      A deep cartography of the universe —  
      its structure, its missions, and humanity’s longest journey upward.

<!-- ABOUT -->
<section>
  <h2>About Void Atlas</h2>
  <p>
    Void Atlas is not a news site, not a blog, and not a textbook.
    It is a long-form space intelligence platform designed to document
    humanity’s relationship with the universe in depth.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the invisible gas between stars to the boots that touched the Moon,
    Void Atlas exists to explain space as it truly is — vast, hostile,
    beautiful, and largely unexplored.
  </p>

<!-- SPACE REALITY -->
<section class="panel">
  <h2>Space Is Not Empty</h2>
  <p>
    The word “vacuum” often misleads people into believing space is nothingness.
    In reality, space contains matter, energy, radiation, magnetic fields,
    and fundamental forces operating at cosmic scales.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interstellar space is filled with hydrogen gas, cosmic dust,
    and energetic particles traveling near the speed of light.
    Even the most empty regions of the universe are not truly empty.
  </p>

  <h3>Interstellar Gas</h3>
  <p>
    Hydrogen and helium dominate the universe.
    Massive clouds of these gases collapse under gravity to form stars.
    Without gas, there would be no galaxies, no planets, and no life.
  </p>

  <h3>Radiation & Background Energy</h3>
  <p>
    The Cosmic Microwave Background is leftover radiation from the Big Bang,
    still detectable today.
    It defines the base temperature of the universe at approximately 2.7 Kelvin.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- GK -->
<section>
  <h2>Do You Know? — Cosmic Reality</h2>

  <p>• A single day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus.</p>
  <p>• The Milky Way contains over 100 billion stars.</p>
  <p>• Light from the Sun takes 8 minutes to reach Earth.</p>
  <p>• Neutron stars can spin hundreds of times per second.</p>
  <p>• The universe is expanding faster every second.</p>
  <p>• More than 95% of the universe is invisible to us.</p>
</section>

<!-- ISRO -->
<section class="panel">
  <h2>ISRO — India’s Space Journey</h2>
  <p>
    The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) represents one of the most
    cost-effective and precise space programs in the world.
    With limited budgets, ISRO has achieved missions that rival global agencies.
  </p>

  <h3>Chandrayaan-1</h3>
  <p>
    Launched in 2008, Chandrayaan-1 confirmed the presence of water molecules
    on the Moon. This discovery reshaped lunar science and future exploration.
  </p>

  <h3>Chandrayaan-2</h3>
  <p>
    Although the lander failed during descent, the orbiter continues to operate,
    delivering high-resolution lunar data and mapping resources.
  </p>

  <h3>Chandrayaan-3</h3>
  <p>
    In 2023, India became the first nation to land near the Moon’s south pole —
    a region critical for future human missions due to potential water ice.
  </p>

  <h3>Mangalyaan (Mars Orbiter Mission)</h3>
  <p>
    India reached Mars on its first attempt, demonstrating advanced navigation,
    communication, and deep-space engineering capabilities.
  </p>

<!-- NASA -->
<section>
  <h2>NASA — Humanity Beyond Earth</h2>
  <p>
    NASA has driven space exploration from the early Cold War era
    to modern deep-space telescopes and interplanetary rovers.
  </p>

  <h3>Apollo Program</h3>
  <p>
    Between 1969 and 1972, NASA landed humans on the Moon six times.
    Apollo missions proved that humans could survive, work,
    and return from another celestial body.
  </p>

  <h3>Why Apollo Still Matters</h3>
  <p>
    Apollo was not just a political victory.
    It was an engineering miracle achieved with computers weaker
    than today’s smartphones.
  </p>
</section>

<div class="divider"></div>

<!-- MOON -->
<section class="panel">
  <h2>Moon Missions — Global Effort</h2>
  <p>
    The Moon remains humanity’s primary testing ground for deep-space exploration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Countries across the world now view the Moon as a gateway —
    not a destination, but a stepping stone toward Mars and beyond.
  </p>
</section>

<div class="divider"></div>

<!-- MARS -->
<section>
  <h2>Mars — The Next Frontier</h2>
  <p>
    Mars is the most Earth-like planet in the solar system,
    yet it is hostile, cold, and radiation-filled.
  </p>

  <h3>Why Mars?</h3>
  <p>
    Mars once had water, rivers, and possibly life.
    Studying Mars helps answer one question:
    Was Earth ever unique?
  </p>

  <h3>Mount Olympus</h3>
  <p>
    Mount Olympus is the tallest volcano in the solar system,
    standing nearly 22 kilometers high —
    almost three times taller than Mount Everest.
  </p>

<!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
<section>
  <h2 style="text-align:center;opacity:.9">
    We explore space not because it is easy,  
    but because ignorance is heavier than gravity.
